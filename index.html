    Overall: Excellent implementation. Clean visually and mobile. Very interesting implementation
    of listening on resize and then auto collapsing the content area. Some syntax issues in media queries
    and your calling of a dynamic import() while importing the item above it already (card w/ icon in it)
    attempts to hit a bonus section but falls a bit short.

    There's some mix ups between icon, myIcon, accentColor and the statefulness of when and how to best
    pass that down between elements. It's important to try and have a single source of truth here and
    if you switch everything to use 'type' as that source of truth it helps. Also using the css vars
    of simple colors via the accent color (used in the PR) you'll get the color you want without
    manually setting the css variable in the template.

    I also have mixed feelings about the click to expand capability. For example, I like the text on
    the card face and want to select it. I click to select the text or double click and now I'm opening
    and closing the card over and over. Earlier comps I saw you have had a button to press that did the
    same effect.

    -1 A few typos and state issues though they don't influence the design. Overall a very impressive element
    and with minor enhancements / refactoring we could use this in production with minimal additional effort.

    I'm going to issue a PR that has all the code changes I would have cleaned up so you can see exactly
    How I would have cleaned some things up.

    Overall: Code is very well written, simple, and refined. Very little
    that I had to remove in order to give feedback for this and I only broke
    things out below because you had multiple - and + events.

    subheader in LearningCard is not translatable which wasn't part of this
    assignment but a consideration worth thinking about going into the last
    submission. Scaffold I also gutted just to illustrate how little is needed here.

    LearningCard's use of circle-button-fj isn't wrong but could have been matched
    with a ::slotted(*) still, impressive use of contextually applied CSS. +.25 and
    nice simple CSS responsiveness overall with regard to window resize. Clicking
    the button has a very small nudge to the padding in the card so that it visually
    moves things based on the button depressing. Not terrible but as you account for
    it in the design via slotting, room for improvement there as well.

    See PR for changes I would have made beyond this but a really strong offering
    in solution of the problem.

    Overview:
    Some minor clean up in the dynamic import. You don't need the full import
    as well as the dynamic import() in the same space. Just the import() is
    enough here. mainheader and subheader are not translatable but nice work
    in the card using type to set them accordinately. the slot thesubheader will allow
    for overriding the output to fix that but mainheader doesn't have that fallback.

    Nice implementation in the card banner to use type to reflect to set color.
    This is a very clever, clean implementation. I don't care for the iconWidth and
    iconHeight method though it is implemented correctly.

    list-style-image: url('../assets/beaker.svg'); is not needed
    font-size: xxx-large; is a weird way to do this that I didn't know worked and
    doesn't have a way of influencing so some CSS variables to influence that would be nice
    
    Element defaults to closed because you need <details open> in order to
    default it open. Either it needs pegged to a variable in the element
    OR you just leave it open. Otherwise there isn't anything visually
    to indicate that it is clickable to expand.

    Overall a really clean implementation that I honestly only had to make
    a few minor changes to to make it more like something I'd build out.
    It could use some more work into responsive design as it breaks down
    a bit via mobile / responsiveness but otherwise this is a grea implementation.

    PR: https://github.com/TheKodingKrab/project-two/pull/36

    Detail breakdown:
    -.1 .yarn directory should be ignored given that it has a massive cache payload
    -.25 element defaults closed which is an a11y issue.

    Overview:
    lol awesome demo page with sound effects. I had to actually play the 1st
    one a lot to see if that was my voice. Nice progressive enhancement
    there with the integration into the card (I know that was your last one but still).

    Simple but effective media query / responsive design, automated tests
    and storybooks are effective. learning-scaffold tag is created but not
    imported. It's used in the shadowRoot but it's just going to behave
    like a div tag because the definition isn't imported. This would
    involve other points off however you already made 4 elements WITHOUT this
    so good there still on that requirement.

    Otherwise a very strong implementation with very little for me to clean
    up in the PR I am issuing for additional enhancements I could have made.
    Consistent clean use of slots, the type variable, CSS variables and reflecting
    attributes for styling changes / reuse.

    Nice attempt on the hax part but you were overthinking it. The joke
    message is a solid save and so your score gets +0 but there's still
    a plus sign involved ;)

    19.15/20
    Overview:
    CardIcon has an a11y issue if this.alt was implemented, but it isn't. So it's just hanging around
    Syntax errors in the Icon to make it appear correct, however when I fix these issues in the CSS
    it ends up making the icon take on baackground colors and colors that are not expected.
    It also had haxProperties which were not implemented and should have been removed.

    ToggleContent visibility state is a little clunky. Avoiding the use of reflected properties yet
    basically achieving same thing through event listeners. While not wrong, there would be no reactivity
    if I was to try and programatically open the collapse or set it's default state. Thus the content
    is ALWAYS collapsed and not able to be in a open by default state which would be an improvement in the
    overall UX / A11y of the material. By default other than an arrow there's no real indication of expanding
    the content and because the effect is applied to an img tag I can't grab a tabindex. As a result this is
    a pretty major accessibility error. The expand is an interesting visual effect which could use a mode
    for disabling the bounce effect based on user preference in a media query.

    I did a lot of reworking on the toggle to be accessible, data reactive and open by default so please
    look to those changes. Overall this is a well made element that implemented HAX and a lot of tests while
    also matching the design and requirements well. Also good job not leaving a lot of excess code behind unused.

    PR: https://github.com/PenStat/penstat-project2/pull/50

    Detail breakdown:
    -.5 syntax errors in CSS of icon
    -.25 a11y issue w/ alt if it was implemented; not implemented though which is still some off
    -1 major accessibility issue with the arrow and content of the card.
    +.5 HIGHLY detailed tests and very professional
    +.4 Card wired up to HAX, minor issue in slot in demoSchema (<p> or other wrapping for perfect usage)

    20/20
    Overview:
    Nice work getting chain selectors working to do deep querying in the shadowRoot's for automated testing
    and reasonable tests (5 of them). The stories look good and you did all of them so +1 there. Initial look
    at the card is visually clean and supports 3 different types that match the comp (purple might be diff color but meh).

    topText and bottomText can't be changed by the user which is unfortunate and is not translatable or able to
    be changed via slots. <h1 slot="top-header">${this.topText}</h1> in learning-banner does nothing for example
    as you'd need <h1><slot name="top-header">.... as well as compositing for it to pass down. You do get compositing
    correct elsewhere but shoot for users being able to override the implementation to set slot="..." in the demo /
    top level element.

    Overall looks correct, nothing fancy but gets the job done and very little code to remove. Also watch for
    blank ...super.properties statements when there's nothing being extending as well as empty methods that
    just call super.whatever.

    PR: https://github.com/IST402-Group-F/Project-2-Card/pull/13
    
    Detail breakdown:
    -.5 for no named slots at top level for implementing in design

    +1 for stories for all elements correctly

    
    @viable-slime/slime-card
    https://github.com/Viable-Slime/easy-card

    Overview:
    17/20 
    Storybook only somewhat works and I had to change the import reference to import '@viable-slime/the-easy-button/easy-button.js';
    instead of how it was imported. While working outside of storybook fine, you should have debugged that a bit more.

    tests pass except 2 which failed on my local bc of the address having a different port. You've got a good idea though
    with that style test. contains would net you more consistent results. Also:
    element.shadowRoot.childNodes[2].childNodes[3].childNodes[3] is... VERY brittle and VERY brute force

    slime-icon hsa a firstUpdated call that is wrapped in super so it wont run without the super running. iconHeight
    and iconWidth are weird ways of setting this value but are possible. this.icon_value = new Map();  is a very
    intersting way of doing this but you don't need the type : Map part as it's not valid in Lit and your this.type
    will ensure that things update appropriately.

    slime-headar had a syntax error in the CSS -.1
    toggle in the slime-card needs a ?toggle="${this.toggle}" to set the value correctly as a boolean -.1
    this.shadowRoot.getElementById("click-target") is not valid, needs to be this.shadowRoot.querySelector("#click-target") -.1
    slot pases down correctly but there are no named slots for additional flexibility -.2

    All the toggle / click stuff doesn't work. It was not a requirement of the element however there's a lot of code that
    is broken / does nothing as a result -.5

    type should be setting icon AND color though accentColor is passed around and works correctly regardless

    Decent visual matching of the comp. It lacks some polish of others and has some issues internally with code to
    clean up but over all a nice job getting the compositing and all the elements working together.

    PR: https://github.com/Viable-Slime/easy-card/pull/4

    Detailed feedback:
    -2 storybook knobs mapped but not all work also had an error where it wouldn't load at all.
    -.5 for things identified throughout overview
    -.5 toggle / other non-functioning code

    https://github.com/runtimeErrorsMadeEasy/project2

    Overview:
    17.5/20
    Nice work on the responsive aspect in the demo. Storybook settings are weak at best but function -1
    Test bed is a mix. There are MANY tests which is great but 3 of the tests have the camel case implementation
    of the class as opposed to web component. For example header.test.js has <learningHeader> as opposed to learning-header
    Fixing this to run the tests causes 1 test to fail per file yet they are good otherwise. -.25
    Weird defaults for showing content in slotted areas. While it works, just sorta weird to do in this case
    as you could have easily just used the index.html to have the content slotted in (1st demo shows this) -.25

    Element matches comp and has an easy to implement "type" driven API. Colors forcibly set are not using the
    accentColor from simple colors and then things using SimpleColors sorta just implement the clas but not
    really using the colors from it in any meaningful way -.5
    myIcon is a weird var name, could just be icon. Good use of CSS variables

    slot names with <slot name="paragraph-format"> and bullet-list and number-list are akward. Could have
    accomplished the same thing with just <slot> or <slot name="content"> so user could pass in whatever
      they defined as opposed to specifically using bullet, etc. -.5

    Overall a good offering that has room for improvement in slotting and some overall polish but otherwise
    is a good representation of the composite and leverages slot composition appropriately.
